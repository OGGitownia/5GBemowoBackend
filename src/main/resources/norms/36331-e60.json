The MIB includes a limited number of most essential and most frequently transmitted parameters that are needed to acquire other information from the cell, and is transmitted on BCH. SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1 are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages and mapping of SIBs to SI messages is flexibly configurable by schedulingInfoList included in SystemInformationBlockType1, with restrictions that: each SIB is contained only in a single SI message, and at most once in that message; only SIBs having the same scheduling requirement (periodicity) can be mapped to the same SI message; SystemInformationBlockType2 is always mapped to the SI message that corresponds to the first entry in the list of SI messages in schedulingInfoList. There may be multiple SI messages transmitted with the same periodicity. SystemInformationBlockType1 and all SI messages are transmitted on DL-SCH.\n\n"},{"content":"The Bandwidth reduced Low Complexity (BL) UEs and UEs in Coverage Enhancement (CE) apply Bandwidth Reduced (BR) version of the SIB or SI messages. A UE considers itself in enhanced coverage as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. In this and subsequent clauses, anything applicable for a particular SIB or SI message equally applies to the corresponding BR version unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nFor NB-IoT, a reduced set of system information block with similar functionality but different content is defined; the UE applies the NB-IoT (NB) version of the MIB and the SIBs. These are denoted MasterInformationBlock-NB and SystemInformationBlockTypeX-NB in this specification. All other system information blocks (without NB suffix) are not applicable to NB-IoT; this is not further stated in the corresponding text.\n\nNOTE 1:\tThe physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take. When DCI format 1C is used the maximum allowed by the physical layer is 1736 bits (217 bytes) while for format 1A the limit is 2216 bits (277 bytes), see TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23]. For BL UEs and UEs in CE, the maximum SIB and SI message size is 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT, the maximum SIB and SI message size is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].\n\nIn addition to broadcasting, E-UTRAN may provide SystemInformationBlockType1 and/or SystemInformationBlockType2, including the same parameter values, via dedicated signalling i.e., within an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.\n\n"},{"content":"The UE applies the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures for the PCell, except when being a BL UE or a UE in CE or a NB-IoT UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode while T311 is not running.

However, a UE that is configured with DC shall aquire the MasterInformationBlock of the PSCell but use it only to determine the SFN timing of the SCG, which may be different from the MCG. Upon change of the relevant system information of a configured SCell, E-UTRAN releases and subsequently adds the concerned SCell, which may be done with a single RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. If the UE is receiving or interested to receive an MBMS service in a cell, the UE shall apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedure to acquire parameters relevant for MBMS operation and apply the parameters acquired from system information only for MBMS operation for this cell.\n\nNOTE 2:\tE-UTRAN may configure via dedicated signalling different parameter values than the ones broadcast in the concerned SCell.\n\nIn MBMS-dedicated cell, non-MBSFN subframes are used for providing MasterInformationBlock-MBMS (MIB-MBMS) and SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS. SIBs other than SystemInformationBlockType1-MBMS are carried in SystemInformation-MBMS message which is also provided on non-MBSFN subframes.\n\n"},{"content":"An RN configured with an RN subframe configuration does not need to apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures.

Each SI message is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is configurable. Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be transmitted a number of times in any subframe other than MBSFN subframes, uplink subframes in TDD, and subframe #5 of radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0.

E-UTRAN completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the S1 connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the EPC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the E-UTRAN may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful security activation. However, the UE only accepts a handover message when security has been activated.\n\nNOTE:\tIn case the serving frequency broadcasts multiple overlapping bands, E-UTRAN can only configure measurements after having obtained the UE capabilities, as the measurement configuration needs to be set according to the band selected by the UE.\n\nUpon receiving the UE context from the EPC, E-UTRAN activates security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.\n\n"},{"content":"After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN initiates the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. E-UTRAN may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial security activation from the UE. In any case, E-UTRAN will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC connection reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs. E-UTRAN should release the RRC connection if the initial security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails (i.e. security activation and DRB establishment are triggered by a joint S1-procedure, which does not support partial success).\n\nFor SRB2 and DRBs, security is always activated from the start, i.e. the E-UTRAN does not establish these bearers prior to activating security.\n\nFor some radio configuration fields, a critical extension has been defined. A switch from the original version of the field to the critically extended version is allowed using any connection reconfiguration. The UE reverts to the original version of some critically extended fields upon handover and re-establishment as specified elsewhere in this specification. Otherwise, switching a field from the critically extended version to the original version is only possible using the handover or re-establishment procedure with the full configuration option. This also applies for fields that are critically extended within a release (i.e. original and extended version defined in same release).\n\n"},{"content":"After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN may configure a UE that supports CA, with one or more SCells in addition to the PCell that was initially configured during connection establishment. The PCell is used to provide the security inputs and upper layer system information (i.e. the NAS mobility information e.g. TAI). SCells are used to provide additional downlink and optionally uplink radio resources. When not configured with DC all SCells the UE is configured with, if any, are part of the MCG. When configured with DC however, some of the SCells are part of a SCG. In this case, user data carried by a DRB may either be transferred via MCG (i.e. MCG-DRB), via SCG (SCG-DRB) or via both MCG and SCG in DL while E-UTRAN configures the CG used in UL (split DRB). An RRC connection reconfiguration message may be used to change the DRB type from MCG-DRB to SCG-DRB or to split DRB, as well as from SCG-DRB or split DRB to MCG-DRB.\n\nSCG change is a synchronous SCG reconfiguration procedure (i.e. involving RA to the PSCell) including reset/ re-establishment of layer 2 and, if SCG DRBs are configured, refresh of security. The procedure is used in a number of different scenarios e.g. SCG establishment, PSCell change, Key refresh, change of DRB type. The UE performs the SCG change related actions upon receiving an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG, see 5.3.10.10.\n\n"},{"content":"The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by E-UTRAN. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an E-UTRA frequency or an inter-RAT carrier frequency. Only in exceptional cases, as specified within this specification, TS 36.300 [9], TS 36.304 [4] or TS 24.301 [35], may the UE abort the RRC connection, i.e. move to RRC_IDLE without notifying E-UTRAN.\n\nThe suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by E-UTRAN. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE AS context and the resumeIdentity, and transitions to RRC_IDLE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered. Suspension can only be performed when at least 1 DRB is successfully established.\n\nThe resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE has a stored UE AS context, RRC connection resume is permitted by E-UTRAN and the UE needs to transit from RRC_IDLE state to RRC_CONNECTED state. When the RRC connection is resumed, RRC configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE AS context and any RRC configuration received from E-UTRAN. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s). The request to resume the RRC connection includes the resumeIdentity. The request is not ciphered, but protected with a message authentication code.\n\n"},{"content":"In response to a request to resume the RRC connection, E-UTRAN may resume the suspended RRC connection, reject the request to resume and instruct the UE to either keep or discard the stored context, or setup a new RRC connection.\n\n5.3.1.2\tSecurity\n\nAS security comprises of the integrity protection of RRC signalling (SRBs) as well as the ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).\n\nRRC handles the configuration of the security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm and two parameters, namely the keyChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon handover, connection re-establishment and/ or connection resume.\n\nThe integrity protection algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers SRB1 and SRB2. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1, SRB2 and DRBs). Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.\n\nRRC integrity and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/ procedure. RRC integrity and ciphering are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a 'NULL' ciphering algorithm (eea0).\n\nThe 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm (eia0) is used only for the UE in limited service mode [32, TS33.401]. In case the 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm is used, 'NULL' ciphering algorithm is also used.\n\n"},{"content":"NOTE 1:\tLower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity check has failed and indicate the integrity verification check failure to RRC.\n\nThe AS applies three different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). All three AS keys are derived from the KeNB key. The KeNB is based on the KASME key, which is handled by upper layers.\n\nUpon connection establishment new AS keys are derived. No AS-parameters are exchanged to serve as inputs for the derivation of the new AS keys at connection establishment.\n\nThe integrity and ciphering of the RRC message used to perform handover is based on the security configuration used prior to the handover and is performed by the source eNB.\n\nThe integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed upon handover. The four AS keys (KeNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc) change upon every handover, connection re-establishment and connection resume. The keyChangeIndicator is used upon handover and indicates whether the UE should use the keys associated with the KASME key taken into use with the latest successful NAS SMC procedure. The nextHopChainingCount parameter is used upon handover, connection re-establishment and connection resume by the UE when deriving the new KeNB that is used to generate KRRCint, KRRCenc and KUPenc (see TS 33.401 [32]). An intra cell handover procedure may be used to change the keys in RRC_CONNECTED.\n\n"},{"content":"For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]) is maintained for each direction. For each DRB, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering. For each SRB, the COUNT is used as input for both ciphering and integrity protection. It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. At connection resume the COUNT is reset. In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the eNB. The eNB is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same KeNB, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs. In order to avoid such re-use, the eNB may e.g. use different RB identities for successive RB establishments, trigger an intra cell handover or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED transition.\n\nFor each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.\n\n"},{"content":"In case of DC, a separate KeNB is used for SCG-DRBs (S-KeNB). This key is derived from the key used for the MCG (KeNB) and an SCG counter that is used to ensure freshness. To refresh the S-KeNB e.g. when the COUNT will wrap around, E-UTRAN employs an SCG change, i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including mobilityControlInfoSCG. When performing handover, while at least one SCG-DRB remains configured, both KeNB and S-KeNB are refreshed. In such case E-UTRAN performs handover with SCG change i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including both mobilityControlInfo and mobilityControlInfoSCG. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers within a CG but may be different between MCG and SCG. The ciphering algorithm for SCG DRBs can only be changed upon SCG change.\n\n5.3.1.2a\tRN security\n\nFor RNs, AS security follows the procedures in 5.3.1.2. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may configure per DRB whether or not integrity protection is used. The use of integrity protection may be configured only upon DRB establishment and reconfigured only upon handover or upon the first reconfiguration following RRC connection re-establishment.\n\n"},{"content":"To provide integrity protection on DRBs between the RN and the E-UTRAN, the KUPint key is derived from the KeNB key as described in TS33.401 [32]. The same integrity protection algorithm used for SRBs also applies to the DRBs. The KUPint changes at every handover and RRC connection re-establishment and is based on an updated KeNB which is derived by taking into account the nextHopChainingCount. The COUNT value maintained for DRB ciphering is also used for integrity protection, if the integrity protection is configured for the DRB.\n\n5.3.1.3\tConnected mode mobility\n\nIn RRC_CONNECTED, the network controls UE mobility, i.e. the network decides when the UE shall connect to which E-UTRA cell(s), or inter-RAT cell. For network controlled mobility in RRC_CONNECTED, the PCell can be changed using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfo (handover), whereas the SCell(s) can be changed using the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message either with or without the mobilityControlInfo.\n\nAn SCG can be established, reconfigured or released by using an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message with or without the mobilityControlInfo. In case Random Access to the PSCell or initial PUSCH transmission to the PSCell if rach-SkipSCG is configured is required upon SCG reconfiguration, E-UTRAN employs the SCG change procedure (i.e. an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message including the mobilityControlInfoSCG). The PSCell can only be changed using the SCG change procedure and by release and addition of the PSCell.\n\n"},{"content":"The network triggers the handover procedure e.g. based on radio conditions, load. To facilitate this, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting (possibly including the configuration of measurement gaps). The network may also initiate handover blindly, i.e. without having received measurement reports from the UE.\n\nBefore sending the handover message to the UE, the source eNB prepares one or more target cells. The source eNB selects the target PCell. The source eNB may also provide the target eNB with a list of best cells on each frequency for which measurement information is available, in order of decreasing RSRP. The source eNB may also include available measurement information for the cells provided in the list. The target eNB decides which SCells are configured for use after handover, which may include cells other than the ones indicated by the source eNB. If an SCG is configured, handover involves either SCG release or SCG change. In case the UE was configured with DC, the target eNB indicates in the handover message whether the UE shall release the entire SCG configuration. Upon connection re-establishment, the UE releases the entire SCG configuration except for the DRB configuration, while E-UTRAN in the first reconfiguration message following the re-establishment either releases the DRB(s) or reconfigures the DRB(s) to MCG DRB(s).\n\n"},{"content":"The target eNB generates the message used to perform the handover, i.e. the message including the AS-configuration to be used in the target cell(s). The source eNB transparently (i.e. does not alter values/ content) forwards the handover message/ information received from the target to the UE. When appropriate, the source eNB may initiate data forwarding for (a subset of) the DRBs.\n\nAfter receiving the handover message, the UE attempts to access the target PCell at the first available RACH occasion according to Random Access resource selection defined in TS 36.321 [6], i.e. the handover is asynchronous, or at the first available PUSCH occasion if rach-Skip is configured. Consequently, when allocating a dedicated preamble for the random access in the target PCell, E-UTRA shall ensure it is available from the first RACH occasion the UE may use. The first available PUSCH occasion is provided by ul-ConfigInfo, if configured, otherwise UE shall monitor the PDCCH of target eNB. Upon successful completion of the handover, the UE sends a message used to confirm the handover.\n\n"},{"content":"If the target eNB does not support the release of RRC protocol which the source eNB used to configure the UE, the target eNB may be unable to comprehend the UE configuration provided by the source eNB. In this case, the target eNB should use the full configuration option to reconfigure the UE for Handover and Re-establishment. Full configuration option includes an initialization of the radio configuration, which makes the procedure independent of the configuration used in the source cell(s) with the exception that the security algorithms are continued for the RRC re-establishment.\n\nAfter the successful completion of handover, PDCP SDUs may be re-transmitted in the target cell(s). This only applies for DRBs using RLC-AM mode and for handovers not involving full configuration option. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8]. After the successful completion of handover not involving full configuration option, the SN and the HFN are reset except for the DRBs using RLC-AM mode (for which both SN and HFN continue). For reconfigurations involving the full configuration option, the PDCP entities are newly established (SN and HFN do not continue) for all DRBs irrespective of the RLC mode. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8].\n\nOne UE behaviour to be performed upon handover is specified, i.e. this is regardless of the handover procedures used within the network (e.g. whether the handover includes X2 or S1 signalling procedures).\n\n"},{"content":"The source eNB should, for some time, maintain a context to enable the UE to return in case of handover failure. After having detected handover failure, the UE attempts to resume the RRC connection either in the source PCell or in another cell using the RRC re-establishment procedure. This connection resumption succeeds only if the accessed cell is prepared, i.e. concerns a cell of the source eNB or of another eNB towards which handover preparation has been performed. The cell in which the re-establishment procedure succeeds becomes the PCell while SCells and STAGs, if configured, are released.\n\nNormal measurement and mobility procedures are used to support handover to cells broadcasting a CSG identity. In addition, E-UTRAN may configure the UE to report that it is entering or leaving the proximity of cell(s) included in its CSG whitelist. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may request the UE to provide additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell e.g. global cell identity, CSG identity, CSG membership status.\n\nNOTE:\tE-UTRAN may use the 'proximity report' to configure measurements as well as to decide whether or not to request additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell. The additional information is used to verify whether or not the UE is authorised to access the target PCell and may also be needed to identify handover candidate cell (PCI confusion i.e. when the physical layer identity that is included in the measurement report does not uniquely identify the cell).\n\n"},{"content":"5.3.1.4\tConnection control in NB-IoT\n\nIn NB-IoT, during the RRC connection establishment procedure, SRB1bis is established implicitly with SRB1. SRB1bis uses the logical channel identity defined in 9.1.2a, with the same configuration as SRB1 but no PDCP entity. SRB1bis is used until security is activated. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful response) are sent over SRB1 being integrity protected and ciphering is started after completion of the procedure.

E-UTRAN provides the measurement configuration applicable for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED by means of dedicated signalling, i.e. using the RRCConnectionReconfiguration or RRCConnectionResume message.\n\nThe UE can be requested to perform the following types of measurements:\n\n-\tIntra-frequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).\n\n-\tInter-frequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ from any of the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).\n\n-\tInter-RAT measurements of UTRA frequencies.\n\n-\tInter-RAT measurements of GERAN frequencies.\n\n-\tInter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or CDMA2000 1xRTT or WLAN frequencies.\n\n-\tCBR measurements.\n\n"},{"content":"The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:\n\n1.\tMeasurement objects: The objects on which the UE shall perform the measurements.\n\n-\tFor intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency, E-UTRAN can configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'blacklisted' cells and a list of 'whitelisted' cells. Blacklisted cells are not considered in event evaluation or measurement reporting.\n\n-\tFor inter-RAT UTRA measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single UTRA carrier frequency.\n\n-\tFor inter-RAT GERAN measurements a measurement object is a set of GERAN carrier frequencies.\n\n-\tFor inter-RAT CDMA2000 measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single (HRPD or 1xRTT) carrier frequency.\n\n-\tFor inter-RAT WLAN measurements a measurement object is a set of WLAN identifiers and optionally a set of WLAN frequencies.\n\n-\tFor CBR measurements a measurement object is a set of transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication.\n\nNOTE 1:\tSome measurements using the above mentioned measurement objects, only concern a single cell, e.g. measurements used to report neighbouring cell system information, PCell UE Rx-Tx time difference, or a pair of cells, e.g. SSTD measurements between the PCell and the PSCell.\n\n2.\tReporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where each reporting configuration consists of the following:\n\n"},{"content":"-\tReporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.\n\n-\tReporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement report and associated information (e.g. number of cells to report).\n\n3.\tMeasurement identities: A list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is used as a reference number in the measurement report.\n\n4.\tQuantity configurations: One quantity configuration is configured per RAT type. The quantity configuration defines the measurement quantities and associated filtering used for all event evaluation and related reporting of that measurement type. One filter can be configured per measurement quantity.\n\n5.\tMeasurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements, i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.\n\n"},{"content":"E-UTRAN only configures a single measurement object for a given frequency (except for WLAN and except for CBR measurements), i.e. it is not possible to configure two or more measurement objects for the same frequency with different associated parameters, e.g. different offsets and/ or blacklists. E-UTRAN may configure multiple instances of the same event e.g. by configuring two reporting configurations with different thresholds.\n\nThe UE maintains a single measurement object list, a single reporting configuration list, and a single measurement identities list. The measurement object list includes measurement objects, that are specified per RAT type, possibly including intra-frequency object(s) (i.e. the object(s) corresponding to the serving frequency(ies)), inter-frequency object(s) and inter-RAT objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes E-UTRA and inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.\n\nThe measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:\n\n1.\tThe serving cell(s) - these are the PCell and one or more SCells, if configured for a UE supporting CA.\n\n"},{"content":"2.\tListed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s) or, for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs matching the WLAN identifiers configured in the measurement object or the WLAN the UE is connected to.\n\n3.\tDetected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the carrier frequency(ies) indicated by the measurement object(s) or, for inter-RAT WLAN, the WLANs not included in the measObjectWLAN but meeting the triggering requirements.\n\nFor E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s), listed cells, detected cells, transmission resource pools for V2X sidelink communication, and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on any reception on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and optionally on cells that are within a range for which reporting is allowed by E-UTRAN. For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on detected cells. For inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For inter-RAT WLAN, the UE measures and reports on listed cells.\n\nNOTE 2:\tFor inter-RAT UTRA and CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports also on detected cells for the purpose of SON.\n\n"},{"content":"NOTE 3:\tThis specification is based on the assumption that typically CSG cells of home deployment type are not indicated within the neighbour list.

Most of the MBMS control information is provided on a logical channel specific for MBMS common control information: the MCCH. E-UTRA employs one MCCH logical channel per MBSFN area. In case the network configures multiple MBSFN areas, the UE acquires the MBMS control information from the MCCHs that are configured to identify if services it is interested to receive are ongoing. The action applicable when the UE is unable to simultaneously receive MBMS and unicast services is up to UE implementation. In this release of the specification, an MBMS capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service (also possibly on more than one MBSFN area) in parallel is left for UE implementation. The MCCH carries the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message, which indicates the MBMS sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) radio resource configuration. The MCCH may also carry the MBMSCountingRequest message, when E-UTRAN wishes to count the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED that are receiving or interested to receive one or more specific MBMS services.\n\n"},{"content":"A limited amount of MBMS control information is provided on the BCCH. This primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the MCCH(s). This information is carried by means of a single MBMS specific SystemInformationBlock: SystemInformationBlockType13. An MBSFN area is identified solely by the mbsfn-AreaId in SystemInformationBlockType13. At mobility, the UE considers that the MBSFN area is continuous when the source cell and the target cell broadcast the same value in the mbsfn-AreaId.\n\n5.8.1.2\tScheduling\n\nThe MCCH information is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period. Scheduling information is not provided for MCCH i.e. both the time domain scheduling as well as the lower layer configuration are semi-statically configured, as defined within SystemInformationBlockType13.\n\nFor MBMS user data, which is carried by the MTCH logical channel, E-UTRAN periodically provides MCH scheduling information (MSI) at lower layers (MAC). This MCH information only concerns the time domain scheduling i.e. the frequency domain scheduling and the lower layer configuration are semi-statically configured. The periodicity of the MSI is configurable and defined by the MCH scheduling period.\n\n5.8.1.3\tMCCH information validity and notification of changes\n\n"},{"content":"Change of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType13.\n\nWhen the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change during a first modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated MCCH information. These general principles are illustrated in figure 5.8.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different MCCH information. Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services acquires the new MCCH information immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH information.\n\n\u0013 EMBED Word.Picture.8  \u0014\u0001\u0015\n\nFigure 5.8.1.3-1: Change of MCCH Information\n\n"},{"content":"Indication of an MBMS specific RNTI, the M-RNTI (see TS 36.321 [6]), on PDCCH is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about an MCCH information change. When receiving an MCCH information change notification, the UE knows that the MCCH information will change at the next modification period boundary. The notification on PDCCH indicates which of the MCCHs will change, which is done by means of an 8-bit bitmap. Within this bitmap, the bit at the position indicated by the field notificationIndicator is used to indicate changes for that MBSFN area: if the bit is set to \"1\", the corresponding MCCH will change. No further details are provided e.g. regarding which MCCH information will change. The MCCH information change notification is used to inform the UE about a change of MCCH information upon session start or about the start of MBMS counting.\n\nThe MCCH information change notifications on PDCCH are transmitted periodically and are carried on MBSFN subframes only except on MBMS-dedicated cell or FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell where the MCCH information change is provided on non-MBSFN subframes. These MCCH information change notification occasions are common for all MCCHs that are configured, and configurable by parameters included in SystemInformationBlockType13: a repetition coefficient, a radio frame offset and a subframe index. These common notification occasions are based on the MCCH with the shortest modification period.\n\n"},{"content":"NOTE 1:\tE-UTRAN may modify the MBMS configuration information provided on MCCH at the same time as updating the MBMS configuration information carried on BCCH i.e. at a coinciding BCCH and MCCH modification period.

In this release of the specification, an SC-PTM capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service in parallel is left for UE implementation.\n\n"},{"content":"A limited amount of SC-PTM control information is provided on the BCCH or BR-BCCH. This primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the SC-MCCH.\n\nNOTE:\tFor BL UEs and UEs in CE, SC-MCCH transmission uses a 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth and a maximum TBS of 936 bits, see TS 36.213 [23]. For NB-IoT UEs, the maximum TBS for SC-MCCH transmission is 680 bits, see TS 36.213 [23].\n\n5.8a.1.2\tSC-MCCH scheduling\n\nThe SC-MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over SC-MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period. SC-MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated on PDCCH.\n\n5.8a.1.3\tSC-MCCH information validity and notification of changes\n\n"},{"content":"Change of SC-MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same SC-MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType20 (SystemInformationBlockType20-NB in NB-IoT). If H-SFN is provided in SystemInformationBlockType1-BR, modification period boundaries for BL UEs or UEs in CE are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0. The modification period boundaries for NB-IoT UEs are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m=0.\n\nWhen the network changes (some of) the SC-MCCH information, it notifies the UEs, other than BL UEs, UEs in CE or NB-IoT UEs, about the change in the first subframe which can be used for SC-MCCH transmission in a repetition period. LSB bit in 8-bit bitmap when set to '1' indicates the change in SC-MCCH. Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services transmitted using SC-PTM acquires the new SC-MCCH information starting from the same subframe.

The notification is transmitted with 1 bit. The bit, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBMS service(s), see TS 36.212 [22, 5.3.3.1.14 & 6.4.3.3].

The notification is transmitted with a 2 bit bitmap. The LSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the change of the on-going MBMS service and the MSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBMS service(s), see TS 36.212 [22, 5.3.3.1.12 & 5.3.3.1.13 & 6.4.3.2].

X.691 [15].\n\nThe following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691:\n\n-\tWhen a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.\n\nNOTE:\tThe terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec.

ASN.1\n\nEditor's note\tNo agreements have been reached concerning the extension of RRC PDUs so far. Any statements in this section about the protocol extension mechanism should be considered as FFS.\n\nA.1\tIntroduction\n\nThe following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.\n\nA.2\tProcedural specification\n\nA.2.1\tGeneral principles\n\nThe procedural specification provides an overall high level description regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.\n\n"},{"content":"It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU section e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple fields.\n\nLikewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are send to E-UTRAN i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.\n\nA.2.2\tMore detailed aspects\n\nThe following more detailed conventions should be used:\n\n-\tBullets:\n\n-\tCapitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'\n\n-\tAll bullets, including the last one in a sub-clause, should end with a semi-colon i.e. an ';'\n\n-\tConditions\n\n-\tWhenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if cond1; or cond2:\n\nA.3\tPDU specification\n\nA.3.1\tGeneral principles\n\nA.3.1.1\tASN.1 sections\n\nThe RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].\n\n"},{"content":"The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string \"ASN1START\" (in all upper case letters). Each ASN.1 section ends with a text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text \"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters):\n\n-- ASN1START\n\n-- ASN1STOP\n\nThe text paragraphs containing the ASN.1 start and stop tags should not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the specification.\n\nNOTE:\tA typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.\n\nA.3.1.2\tASN.1 identifier naming conventions\n\nThe naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:\n\n"},{"content":"-\tMessage (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.\n\n-\tType identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.\n\n-\tField identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.\n\n-\tIdentifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.\n\n-\tIdentifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.\n\n"},{"content":"-\tFor future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/ or type. A suffix of the form \"\u001erX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/ first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. A suffix of the form \"\u001erXb\" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, \"\u001erXc\" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form \"\u001evXYZ\" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or type (see sub-clause A.4), e.g., AnElement-v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.\n\n"},{"content":"-\tMore generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.\n\nTable A.3.1.2-1: Examples of typical abbreviations used in ASN.1 identifiers\n\nAbbreviation\u0007\n\nAbbreviated word\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nComm\u0007\n\nCommunication\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nConf\u0007\n\nConfirmation\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nConfig\u0007\n\nConfiguration\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nDisc\u0007\n\nDiscovery\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nDL\u0007\n\nDownlink\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nExt\u0007\n\nExtension\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nFreq\u0007\n\nFrequency\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nId\u0007\n\nIdentity\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nInd\u0007\n\nIndication\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nInfo\u0007\n\nInformation\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nMeas\u0007\n\nMeasurement\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nNeigh\u0007\n\nNeighbour(ing)\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nParam(s)\u0007\n\nParameter(s)\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nPersist\u0007\n\nPersistent\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nPhys\u0007\n\nPhysical\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nProc\u0007\n\nProcess\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nReestab\u0007\n\nReestablishment\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nReq\u0007\n\nRequest\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nRx\u0007\n\nReception\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nSched\u0007\n\nScheduling\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nSync\u0007\n\nSynchronisation\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nThresh\u0007\n\nThreshold\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nTx/ Transm\u0007\n\nTransmission\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nUL\u0007\n\nUplink\u0007\n\n\u0007\n\nNOTE:\tThe table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive.

the ASN.1 transfer syntax support i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.\n\nA UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease shall comprehend the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features it does not support.\n\nIn case a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease supports a feature specified in release X+ N (i.e. early UE implementation) additional requirements apply.\n\nCricitical extensions (dedicated signaling)\n\n"},{"content":"If the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions (i.e. case of dedicated signaling), the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the feature implemented early. This in particular concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the feature. The UE obviously also has to support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE capabilities).\n\nIf configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release X+ N involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented feature(s), the UE need however not support functionality beyond what is defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.\n\n"},{"content":"Let's consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field accessStratumRelease that supports the features associated with fields A1, A3 and A5 of InformationElementA (see ASN.1 below). The feature implemented early is associated with field A5, and can only be configured by the –rX+N version of InformationElementA.  In such case, the UE should support configuration of the features associated with fields A1, A3 and A5 by the –rX+N version of InformationElementA. If however one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature associated with fieldA3, E-UTRAN should assume the UE only supports the feature according to the release it indicated in field accessStratumRelease (X). I.e. UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (n80-vX+N0) nor the additional sub-field (fieldA3a).\n\nInformationElementA-rX ::=\tSEQUENCE {\n\nfieldA1-rX\t\t\tInformationElementA1-rX\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need ON\n\nfieldA2-rX\t\t\tInformationElementA2-rX\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\n\nfieldA3-rX\t\t\tInformationElementA3-rX\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n\n}\n\nInformationElementA-rX+N ::=\tSEQUENCE {\n\nfieldA1-rX+N\t\t\tInformationElementA1-rX\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need ON\n\nfieldA2-rX+N\t\t\tInformationElementA2-rX\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\n\nfieldA3-rX+N\t\t\tInformationElementA3-rX+N\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\n\nfieldA4-rX+N\t\t\tInformationElementA4-rX+N\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\n\nfieldA5-rX+N\t\t\tInformationElementA5-rX+N\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n\n}\n\nInformationElementA3-rX+N ::=\tSEQUENCE {\n\nfieldA1a-rX+N\t\t\tInformationElementA1a-rX\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need ON\n\nfieldA2a-rX+N\t\t\tENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40,\n\nn80-vX+N0}\t\t\tOPTIONAL,\t-- Need OR\n\n"},{"content":"fieldA3a-rX+N\t\t\tInformationElementA3a-rX+N\t\tOPTIONAL\t-- Need OR\n\n}\n\nNon-cricitical extensions (broadcast signaling)\n\nIf the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in broadcast signaling (i.e. system information), the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X+ N that are related to the feature implemented early.
